# Twitter-Data-Text-Mining
Twitter data constitutes a rich source that can be used for capturing information about any topic imaginable. This data can be used in different use cases such as
finding trends related to a specific keyword, measuring brand sentiment, and gathering feedback about new products and
services. In this study Iâ€™m using Twitter data to compare the popularity of 2 games: Cricket and Football, and to retrieve
related links about these sports. Twitter is a place where people to express their opinions and display sentiments on these occasions.
So I extended my sentiment analysis on collected Twitter data, in order to extract sentiments conveyed by the user, which derives
opinion from the tweets and formulates a sentiment.
